New iOS Version
---------------
  From this directory:
  1. Open the XCode Project
    `$ open Jumper.xcodeproj`
  2. Attempt to run the app by pressing the play button in the upper left of XCode.
  
  If something goes wrong:
    * Try going to menu Project > (Hold Alt) > Clean Build Folder...
      - If that doesn't work. Ask Dillon, haha.
